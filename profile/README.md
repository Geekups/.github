### and I should say welcome to Dayana

here is my idea for a long time. building such organization on GitHub and having my own programming Team and Family.
and finally, I built this place with my young and smart friends,

we work here together
learn and practice
improve ourself
improve our family
build tools, apps, websites
working on AI and ML
discuss with each other and solve problems
help new people to grow with us and feed them with our knowledge tree
get customers and do their jobs
build multi-dimensional projects with multi-purpose all around the world
we have special teams for every part of programming and IT
Penetration Testers, developers, Data Scientists, Designers, Graphic Specialists, Bussiness Assistance, Security Specialists, and ...
we are growing continuously
nothing can stop this concept.
even if I die, my brothers and sisters will continue our family plans.
